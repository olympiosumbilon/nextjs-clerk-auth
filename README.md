This project features a fully customized authentication flow using Clerk. Instead of relying on Clerk’s pre-built sign-in and sign-up components, I implemented custom-designed components for the login and sign-up pages, providing a more personalized and consistent user experience. The authentication logic is fully integrated with Clerk’s backend, ensuring secure and reliable user handling. Additionally, a basic protected dashboard is included, accessible only to authenticated users. The setup follows Clerk’s best practices for session and user management while allowing complete design flexibility on the front end.
